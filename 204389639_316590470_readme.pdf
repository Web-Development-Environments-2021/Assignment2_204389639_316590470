Functionalities:
*  added our own board design, more complex that will allow the player a fun and challenging experience.

*  board is of an adjustable size - ensuring complatability to all screen sizes.

*  music on/off toggle - in case the player wants to stop the music during the game.

*  when a player is down to his last two lives, the PacMan's color will change to green , thus indicating
   that his PacMan is "sick" and he needs to be extra carefull

*  the ghosts in our pacman game serve a dual role :
      1. when the ghost are yellow they are on "attack mode" and will try to catch the PacMan using a heuristic 
         "manhatten distance" to try and get to the PacMan as quickly as possible/
      2. if the player ate a cherry, the ghosts will enter a "defence mode" - for the next 6 seconds 
         the ghosts are eatable, and therefore will try to get as far as possible from the PacMan.
         you will also notice that for as long as the ghost are in "defence mode" their color will change to blue
         since they are very very scared. 
         eating a  blue ghost will gain the PacMan a 50 point bonus.
         
*  added some fun colorful gifs to the finished game pop-up.
